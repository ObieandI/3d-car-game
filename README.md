3D Car Simulation â€“ COMP2160 Project
A Unity-based 3D car simulation developed as part of the COMP2160 Game Development unit at Macquarie University. This project focuses on foundational driving mechanics, custom scripting, and interactive environment design.

About the Game
Players control a vehicle navigating a 3D terrain using realistic acceleration, braking, and steering mechanics. The simulation includes checkpoints, health tracking, and a basic UI for feedback and timing. The goal is to create an engaging and testable driving experience within a controlled environment.

Technologies Used
Game Engine: Unity

Scripting: C# (Visual Studio)

Version Control: Git & GitHub Classroom

Collaboration Tools: Google Drive, GitHub Issues

My Role
I contributed to the project with a focus on:

UI & Gameplay Logic: Created the health bar, checkpoint counter, and game timer scripts.

Code Structuring: Helped modularize scripts such as GameManager, PlayerMove, HealthBar, and UIManager.

Debugging & Playability: Tested checkpoint triggers, health depletion, and overall flow for smoother gameplay.

Visual Feedback: Assisted in refining camera angles and on-screen prompts for clearer user interaction.

Challenges Faced
Terrain Clipping: Early terrain models caused the car to clip through geometry. Fixed by adjusting collider shapes and mesh hierarchy.

UI Conflicts: Timer and checkpoint logic initially conflicted; resolved with a single manager script to control game state.

Control Tuning: It took multiple iterations to make driving feel responsive without being too sensitive or slow.

Scope Management: Balancing foundational functionality with feature-creep (e.g., race modes) was necessary for timely delivery.

Key Learnings
Game Architecture: Built and structured interdependent scripts that communicated across systems.

Simulation Scripting: Developed hands-on experience implementing real-time physics and gameplay logic.

Team Coordination: Collaborated on GitHub using Classroom workflows and division of scripting tasks.

Problem-Solving: Learned to debug unexpected Unity behaviors and prioritize features under time pressure.
