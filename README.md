# 3D Car Simulation – COMP2160 Project

A Unity-based 3D driving simulation developed as part of the COMP2160 Game Development unit at Macquarie University. This project focuses on vehicle physics, UI feedback, and modular game systems using object-oriented design.

## About the Game

Players control a car that must navigate a 3D terrain while passing checkpoints, monitoring health, and racing against a timer. The game emphasizes foundational Unity skills such as physics simulation, UI integration, and player interaction through real-time feedback.

## Technologies Used

- **Game Engine:** Unity
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
- **Scripting:** C# (Visual Studio Code)
- **Collaboration Tools:** Discord, Google Drive, Zoom

---

## My Role

- I contributed across the development cycle with a primary focus on:
- **UI & Gameplay Feedback:** Designed and implemented the health bar and checkpoint system.
- **Scripting:** Built scripts for HealthBar, checkpoint logic, and contributed to overall game state control.
- **Debugging:** Helped identify and resolve gameplay issues related to health depletion and checkpoint triggers.
- **User Experience:** Ensured smooth player feedback through UI updates and visual consistency.

## Challenges Faced

- **Terrain Collision Bugs:** Early car movement caused unwanted clipping through terrain, fixed by refining colliders.
- **UI Conflicts:** Timer and checkpoint systems conflicted during game flow—solved by consolidating state management.
- **Balancing Feel:** Fine-tuned driving to feel responsive but controllable within Unity's physics system.
- **Scope Control:** Had to limit feature ideas like lap tracking and multiple car types to finish core systems on time.

## Key Learnings

- **Modular Programming:** Gained confidence in creating reusable C# scripts to control health and checkpoint logic.
- **UI Design in Unity:** Learned to synchronize in-game events with real-time visual feedback.
- **Collaborative Development:** Practiced GitHub Classroom collaboration and division of responsibilities.
- **Debugging Under Pressure:** Developed faster workflows for identifying and fixing gameplay errors.
