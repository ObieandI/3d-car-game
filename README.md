University Project â€“ GitHub Classroom Submission



This project is a 3D car simulation engine, developed as part of the COMP2160 assignment at Macquarie University. Built using Unity, the game simulates realistic driving physics and environmental interactions in a custom 3D world.



Features:

Realistic car acceleration, braking, and steering



Smooth terrain navigation with responsive controls



3D environment with textured models and camera tracking



Basic collision detection and physics-based handling



Technologies:

Unity 3D Engine



C#



GitHub Classroom for version control and collaboration



This was a collaborative project completed by two students, demonstrating core skills in 3D game development, object-oriented programming, and real-time simulation.
